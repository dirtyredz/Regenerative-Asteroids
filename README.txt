[center][b]COMMANDS[/b][/center]
[hr]
[b]/regen start[/b]
Will force a sector to become a Regenerative Asteroid Field Sector. THIS WILL NOT overwrite anything already in the sector. Turn your start sectors or your players home sectors into regenerative Asteroid Fields.

[b]/regen stop[/b]
Will Remove the Regenerative Asteroids script to be removed. This will not remove any asteroids, just the script. Will also make the sector safe for uninstall.

[b]/regen now[/b]
Will force the script to calculate asteroids and the sector limits, instead of waiting on a player to enter the sector.

[b]/regen set x[/b]
Will set a sector to maintain a specific amount of minable asteroids. This will be Priority over MinableAsteroidLimit and MaintainNaturalAsteroidLimit options.


[center][b]INSTALL[/b][/center]
[hr]

simply copy the DATA and MODS folders inside your steam avorion folder (steam local folder) usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Avorion

[center][size=14pt]THIS MOD IS REQUIRED ONLY TO BE INSTALLED ON THE SERVER NO CLIENT INSTALLATION IS REQUIRED[/size][/center]

[center][b]UNINSTALL[/b][/center]
[hr]

[b]STEP 1[/b]: Replace sectorspecifics.lua with orignial.

[b]STEP 2[/b]: Delete all files associated with this mod.
	After which you need to delete every file installed by this mod (except sectorscripts.lua which needs to be modified)

[b]STEP 3[/b]: Add my Uninstall script to data/scripts/sector/
	then add the data folder included in "UninstallRegenerativeAsteroids.rar" to your Avorion directory. this will add script to terminate and remove the script from each sector you visit which contains the RegenerativeAsteroids Script.

[b]Step 4[/b]: Visit every sector which was a Regenerative Asteroid Sector
	The uninstall is safe to leave in place as it does nothing but kill the script.
	Otherwise if your confident every sector that had the Regenerative Asteroids script has been visited, you can remove the uninstall file aswell.

[b]WARNING [/b]- Failure to remove the script before deleteing the mod will CLEAR the entire sector of every entity (including your ship)

[hr]

All messages except for those alerting the player to the sector will be sent to the console. by default you can access the sector with the ' key.
