Will force a sector to become a Regenerative Asteroid Field Sector. THIS WILL NOT overwrite anything already in the sector. Turn your start sectors or your players home sectors into regenerative Asteroid Fields.

### /regen stop
Will Remove the Regenerative Asteroids script to be removed. This will not remove any asteroids, just the script. Will also make the sector safe for uninstall.

### /regen now
Will force the script to calculate asteroids and the sector limits, instead of waiting on a player to enter the sector.

### /regen set x
Will set a sector to maintain a specific amount of minable asteroids. This will be Priority over MinableAsteroidLimit and MaintainNaturalAsteroidLimit options.
